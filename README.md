# Classic Snake Game 

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



## Overview

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food pellets and growing longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or hits the wall.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly demonstration of game development using web technologies.
